MySQL Configuration for Laravel Project
========================================

Your MySQL database "crypto" has been successfully created!

To configure your Laravel project to use this database, you need to create a .env file in your project root with the following settings:

DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=crypto
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=

Note: Since you're using XAMPP MySQL, the socket path is:
/Applications/XAMPP/xamppfiles/var/mysql/mysql.sock

If you need to specify the socket in your Laravel configuration, you can add:
DB_SOCKET=/Applications/XAMPP/xamppfiles/var/mysql/mysql.sock

To test the connection, you can run:
php artisan migrate

This will run your Laravel migrations against the crypto database.
